# experiments

This repo contains my personal framework(-ish) to easily get going on different types of browser experiments (canvas, 3d, svg), along with a collection of helper utilities that are commonly used for creative coding.

All the experiments can be run on [https://deniz.co/experiments](https://deniz.co/experiments).
